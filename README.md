# Freeling::Analyzer [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/munshkr/freeling-analyzer-ruby.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/munshkr/freeling-analyzer-ruby)

**FreeLing::Analyzer** is a Ruby wrapper around `analyzer`, a binary tool
included in FreeLing's package that allows the user to process a stream of text
with FreeLing.

*This has been tested with version 3.0+ only*.

## Usage

```ruby
text = "Mi amigo Juan Mesa se mesa la barba al lado de la mesa."
analyzer = FreeLing::Analyzer.new(text, :language => :es)

analyzer.tokens.first
# => #<FreeLing::Analyzer::Token form="Mi" lemma="mi" prob=0.995536 tag="DP1CSS">

analyzer.tokens.map { |t| t.lemma }
# => ["mi", "amigo", "juan_mesa", "se", "mesar", "el", "barba", "a+el", "lado", "de", "el", "mesa", "."]
```

## Features

* Analyzer is *lazy*, it does not spawn the process until needed and it sends
  the input text to `analyzer` on demand.
* It just works with the default instalation of FreeLing. Just set the language
  to use and you're good to go.
* It supports Freeling's [client/server mode](http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/doc/userman/html/node84.html). Ex: `FreeLing::Analyzer.new(text, :server_host => 'localhost:50005')` (`analyze` must be running in server mode)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'freeling-analyzer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install freeling-analyzer
